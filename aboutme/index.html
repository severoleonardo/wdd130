    <h2>Leonardo Severo Elias</h2>
    <h2>Severo</h2>
    <p>
 
<p>I am Leo, but everyone calls me by the last name, Severo. I am 28 years old and currently living in Ribeirao Preto, state of Sao Paulo, Brazil. Three years ago I got married to an extraordinary person and we have a daughter who is almost turning two years old.</p>
<p>I already work as a software analyst in a fintech, but I know that education is fundamental to professional success. That's why I decided to pursue a second degree in the technology field, as I believe a bachelor's degree from this particular university can open many doors and enhace my skills.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I also have a very cool hobby that allows me to connect with people from all over the world: I'm a Twitch streamer! It helps me develop important skills for my life, such as communication, creativity, and the ability to solve problems in real time.</p> 
<p>I'm always looking to grow and learn more, and my purpose here is purely to serve, learn, and teach. I want to contribute in the best way possible and I'm excited to learn from all of you. Let's grow together!</p>
